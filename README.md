I have 7 months of professional work experience and 4 months of internship under my belt. During this time, I have gained valuable hands-on experience in software development, honing my skills and learning from real-world projects. 

## Skills:

I am proficient in a diverse range of technologies, including JavaScript, Node.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React, JSX, SCSS, Tailwind, SQL, MongoDB, Git, and Linux. This broad skill set allows me to excel in both front-end and back-end development. I am adept at developing robust and scalable applications that meet the highest standards of quality and performance.

## Continuous Learning

I am passionate about staying up to date with emerging technologies and best practices. To achieve this, I actively engage with online communities, attend webinars and workshops, and undertake personal projects to expand my skill set and explore new technologies.

## Interest in Functional Programming and Beyond

While I have experience with a wide range of technologies, I am particularly interested in functional programming languages. I find their approach to programming fascinating and believe they offer unique perspectives and advantages. As part of my ongoing learning journey, I am currently exploring functional programming concepts and also languages such as C, C++, and Rust. I am excited to dive deeper into these languages and leverage their strengths in my future projects.
